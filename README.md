# YTMusic-TUI

Terminal-based TUI written in Golang using [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview)

# ðŸš§ Project currently on hiatus ðŸš§
There isn't really a good ytmusic API library for Golang which makes it quite hard to develop this project. I have begun working on reverse engineering the YT Music API myself on another [repository](https://github.com/cthdarren/ytmusicapi) so we'll see how it goes. But until then, this project will remain on hiatus.
## Disclaimer

> This is a personal project for me to learn Golang as well as to create my own TUI for YTMusic since I could never find one that fit my needs.
